# MULTILANGUAGE-CODE-ASSISTANT

AI-Powered Code Generation & Explanation Tool for Multiple Programming Languages

🧠 Overview

Multilanguage Code Assistant is an AI-driven coding tool that understands natural language prompts and generates high-quality code in multiple programming languages — including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.
It acts as your personal AI pair-programmer, capable of writing, explaining, and transforming code, all from a simple conversational interface.

Built with Gradio, Python, and a custom LLM backend (codeguru), the project demonstrates how to combine natural language processing, code generation, and interactive UI into a single, production-ready tool.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 AI-Generated Code – Get complete functions, scripts, and modules from plain English.

🌐 Multi-Language Support – Generate solutions in Python, Java, C++, JS, and more.

💬 Context-Aware Conversations – The assistant remembers previous prompts and builds on them.

🔄 Iterative Prompting – Refine and improve generated code with follow-up questions.

🖥️ Interactive Web UI – Clean, minimal interface powered by Gradio.

🔌 Local LLM API Integration – Uses a locally hosted model (codeguru) for fast, private inference.
